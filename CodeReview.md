I have created a Base Class in the Framework to initialize WebDriver and extened that in all three test cases.I did it for resuability of the same code because in the given code we have used it again and again.
I have created another class named as TimeUtil to keep synchronization separately.I did it for resuability of the same code and to make my code look better.I have done this as wait function was called so many times in the test class.
In my case chromedriver.exe file was not working .So I have added it.
