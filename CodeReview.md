I have created a Base Class in the Framework to initialize WebDriver.
I have created another class named as TimeUtil to keep synchronization separately.
I this code we were initially trying to click on frame without switching on it.Hence I have added the same.
In my case chromedriver.exe file was not working .So I have added it.
